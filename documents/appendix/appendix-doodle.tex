\section{Doodle Schedule} \label{sec:appendix-doodle-schedule}
The Doodle schedule shows at which time each participant was able to be online in a collaborative manner. The schedule was only used to create an initial idea of which days each member were available to work on the project. The green boxes shows availability and red boxes unavailability. Each member selected between three time slots for each day in a week. 8AM to 12PM, 12PM to 4PM and 4PM to 8PM. See figure \ref{fig:appendix-doodle-schedule}.
