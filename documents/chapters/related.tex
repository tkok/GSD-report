In the work done by Tiberkak et. al [?] an architecture for Home Automation
System is developed. The system is composed of five subsystems: one responsible
for home automation, one for the local management of rooms, one
for storing data, and a system for enabling communication between the first
two sub systems. Different profiles are defined to improve energy efficiency.
The concept of preferred and required profile is instroduced, to differentiate
between the preferences of a inhabitant and the maximum and minimum values
of each environmental parameter in the required profile. Notifications
and messages are sent between the layers when there is a change in the
status of a room, and a appropriate decision is taken.
