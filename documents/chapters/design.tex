With inspiration from other building management systems (see Section~\ref{chapter:relatedwork}) and looking at the building simulator we had to communicate with, we came up with the concept of policies that consist of two types of statements; \textit{if-statements} and \textit{set statements}. If-statements works as if-statements in many popular GPL's\footnote{General Programming Language (like C++, Java etc.)}, with a conditional expression, a then-clause and an else-clause. Set statements work by setting a value on the building simulator (in effect it acts as an actuator).

During the initial research for scripting languages we looked at several established embeddable scripting languages (see Figure~\ref{tbl:design-scripting-languages}).

* The BSF supports several languages.

In the team we had some initial discussions if we should use tools that could assist us in designing our own DSL\footnote{Domain Specific Language}. Examples of these kind of tools could be technologies like Xtext~\cite{xtext}, Xbase~\cite{xbase} and EMF~\cite{emf}. Xtext is a framework for developing programming languages and domain specific languages. Xbase is a partial programming language built in Xtext and used for integrating into other programming languages and domain specific languages. Xbase would be able to give us an working expression language. EMF is the Eclipse Modeling Framework, a modeling framework and code generation tool. Some of the team members in the danish group had used those technologies during the ITU course Model Driven Development, but no kenyan team members had any experience with these technologies. This would in effect mean that they would need to acquire the skills learned during Model Driven Development, while simultaneous working and contributing to our joint policy engine project. We deemed this unrealistic. Another argument for not using this set of technologies is that Xbase seemed too daunting a project to undertake due to it's current state. At the time of writing, only 25 questions have been tagged with Xbase on~\cite{stackoverflow} - a website used frequently by the danish team members when in need of coding assistance. The lack of Xbase examples and documentation also reveals that it is a very new, and unfinished, product. Since Xbase would be the caretaker of the expression language, we could have opted to forego just that, and still use Xtext and optionally EMF. We considered this but arrived at the conclusion that using Xtext alone would not give us that much, since our language is small. Also the amount of overhead introduced by using Xtext, both in complexity but also in the generated code, would further add to the confusion of our team members with no experience with this technology. 

Based on the these arguments we chose to develop the functionality ourselves. We also considered that task to be more \textit{fun}! We believe that developing our own scripting language was best given the resources we had available and the timespan of the project. Considering the embeddable scripting languages (see Figure~\ref{tbl:design-scripting-languages}) we only needed a small subset of the functionality (mainly the if-then-else construct) and therefore deemed the complexity versus the timewise return of investment unfavorable.

\section{Architecture}
Merriam-Webster defines \textit{policy} as "A definite course or method of action selected from among alternatives and in light of given conditions to guide and determine present and future decisions".

We have defined a policy as a collection of statements operating on sensors and actuators residing in the building simulator. The policy has a start time and a stop time, indicating when it is active. It is also possible to de-activate a policy completely --- without deleting it entirely --- using a boolean flag.

The system that we have designed consists of four overall parts;
\begin{itemize}
	\item The management website (front end)
	\item The policy engine (back end)
	\item The database for storing policies (back end)
	\item The provided building simulator (back end)
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:design-system-architecture} illustrates the relationship of the system parts. It is evident that communication between both the front end and the simulator primarily is achieved through Json. For a more in-depth explanation, refer to Section~\ref{subsec:policyengine}.

In terms of MVC\footnote{Model, View and Controller} the \textit{model} and the \textit{controller} is the servlet containing data and business logic. The servlet reacts to several urls (see Figure~\ref{fig:design-servlet-architecture}), that functions as an interface for an operation needed in the system. The \textit{View} is the rendered html based on JQuery.

\end{figure}

A statement can either be a SetStatement or an IfStatement. The SetStatement sets an value in the simulator. The backend implementation allows nested If-statements. If-then-else statements have been around possible before even the early versions of Basic, and is an established way of achieving conditional computer logic. Even though the intended audience of our system is not considered computer experts, the if-then-else concept is easy to understand and catches on fast when interviewing people. An If-statement can contain multiple expressions which are being anded when evaluated. If the user wants to make an If-statement with or'ed expressions, she will have to use a nested if. This raises the complexity and we do not consider this to be an optimal solution. The optimal solution in this case would have been to make a proper expression language that is recursion safe, for example based on~\cite{left-recursion}. This would also solve our lacking or's in the condition of the if-statements. Unfortunately we did not realize this until around two thirds into the development. Since our jQuery~\cite{jquery} parsing on the frontend naturally is strongly bound to domain classes on the backend (due to JSon serialization using Gson~\cite{gson}), any big changes at that point would affect both the backend and the front-end. We estimated then that it would be too time consuming to change the system. We therefore leave it up to future work (\ref{chapter:discussion}).

\subsection{The management website}
The management website is a small collection of html pages that relies heavily on JQuery. The building policy administrator opens the main page in a browser, and gets an overview of all the policies and can perform CRUD\footnote{Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete} operations on them.

During the design phase for the GUI of the management website, we used Photoshop sketches that we mailed and transferred via Skype to each other. One from the kenyan team also assisted in this phase. After discussing how to best present policies to the building policy administrator in the time we had available, we choose to use both indentation and color coding page layout (see Section~\ref{chapter:implementation}) when presenting the policies. By choosing this type of GUI, as opposed to a more tabular view on the if's, we elected a GUI that is flexible enough to extend to a recursive rendering which clearly matters a greatly when then-clauses can contain other if-statements that again contain then-clauses and so forth. For implementation see Section \ref{chapter:implementation}.

\subsection{The policy engine}\label{subsec:policyengine}
The policy engine consists of a servlet and domain classes for the expression language needed to build policies. 

A statement can either be a SetStatement or an IfStatement. The SetStatement sets an value in the simulator. The backend implementation allows nested If-statements, making the policies both flexible and simple. 

An If-statement can contain multiple expressions that all are being anded when evaluated. If the user wants to make an If-statement with or'ed expressions, she will have to use a nested if. The optimal solution to this would have been to make an expression recursion safe model. We did not have enough time for this, but we will elaborate further on this subject in the discussion (see \ref{sec:product}). 

The statements are organized as a list. Each statement will be executed (set) or evaluated (if) in the order that they are persisted. Each if-statement has two lists that contain the statements belonging to the then-clause and the else-clause.

The servlet is the core of our policy engine. It has three main objectives;

\begin{figure}[b]
\center{
\includegraphics[scale=.5]{chapters/design-servlet-architecture.png}
\caption{A overview model of the PolicyEngineServlet.}\label{fig:design-servlet-architecture}}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The timed, repetitive execution of policies which currently are active
	\item Serving web service requests to the JQuery front end
	\item Serving the management website html files
\end{itemize}

An overview model of the PolicyEngineServlet can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:design-servlet-architecture}.

The servlet container used is Tomcat 7.0.37\footnote{Other versions might work as well}. 

This design was based on several iterations of group discussions. Everyone wanted a solution that worked efficient and fast, within the loosely defined scope that we initially had set for the system development. And clearly, our project should fit in the timeframe allowed for the project.

The first couple of design proposals from some team members were based on SQL integration --- by the means of creating a java sql connection --- directly into the database that the building simulator uses. This direct integration could be argued as being a good, although strongly coupled integration. Also, it did not feel like a real world scenario (which we are sure that ITU intends as being one of the reasons for this course) if we could access the database directly in this way. Traditionally building systems tend to be closed source proprietary systems with few, if any, integration point. Today there exists different kind of protocols (KNX, LON and BACnet to name a few) that allows some integration to existing building automation systems (for example CTS \footnote{Central Tilstandskontrol- og Styring} systems that are widely used in Denmark). Since our project deals with a building simulator, we do not have to worry about these kind of implementation details --- but we are aware that they exist.

Later design proposals revolved around the idea of having more or less mirrored sensor data in a separate database. Data should be transferred at regular intervals, and the policies should be executed against the copy. This turned out to be a too unsophisticated solution, for several reasons. It would involve a lot of overhead copying data from one database to the other. There is also a problem in knowing exactly what data to copy, since that depends on the statements that is currently active. Based on the above mentioned discoveries we decided on the  following design, that takes all team discussions into account and solves all earlier stated challenges.

On servlet container startup the servlet will read various configuration values, and then set up a thread that manages the timed, repetitive execution of active policies. While testing the system policies were executed every 5 seconds, but this is configurable. The servlet will start by querying the database for active policies, which are defined as policies that have a boolean flag (active) set to true, while the current time is within the policie's \textit{from} and \textit{to} time. This will result in a list of policies that should be executed. Then all sensor id values of all if-statements (including nested statements) are fetched from the building simulator, and cached in an in-memory datastructure. Then the policies are executed, and values set accordingly using the rest API.

\subsection{The database}
The database used is mySQL 5.5.29\footnote{Other versions might work as well} and used for storing the policies. At the moment we only use one table containing all the policies.

\subsection{The building simulator}
The building simulator~\cite{simulator} provided in the course has not been changed or modified in any way.
