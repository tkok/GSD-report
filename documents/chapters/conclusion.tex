This project focused on developing an online platform for managing sensors and actuators in a building, with students from Denmark and Kenya. The difficulty of this project consisted of working in a global distributed team and providing a policy engine prototype. We presented our functional prototype which is able to create, modify, and delete policies. The prototype executes the policies against the provided building simulator. We have designed the prototype with usability and flexibility in mind, and it aims to be used by people that are not IT experts. This resulted in having a simple and friendly interface for the users. 
\\Another goal of this project was the collaboration with Kenya but this collaboration has not been a succes for several reasons. We could have done things different but in the end the people from that group did not commit at all for this project. 
Though our prototype works as expected, there can be several improvements. One feature that we would like to have is temporal constraints in the Statement mechanism. This would provide even more flexibility in defining policies. Another improvement would be to employ an analysis mechanism of running policies, which would detect possible conflicts (setting different values on the same actuators) between running policies.
We thank Matias Bjørling, Javier González and Aslak Johansen for their feedback and offered support on the building simulator.
