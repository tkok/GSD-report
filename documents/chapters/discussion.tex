%\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
In this section we are going to discuss our project in three different parts, one being the collaboration with the team members from Kenya, the other being the product and lastly the overall project. We have chosen to analyse each of these areas with an approach of highlighting what could have been done differently and perhaps in a better and more successful way. We will reflect on our choices made during the project and finally also on our learning outcomes.

\subsection{Collaboration}\label{subsec:collaboration}
The collaboration between the students at ITU, Denmark and Strathmore, Kenya, proved to be a rather challenging task. Only one person from Strathmore showed interest in the project, even though this should have been four persons. We believe that this is not caused by our approach towards the students from Kenya but instead by a lack of interest and willingness to work on the project.
With that being said, there could have been multiple ways we could have achieved a better performing team. Our collaboration strategy is still in the early phases due to the fact that we as a group never got to create any real collaboration platform to work from. 
A next approach, that we have tried multiple times to do, could be to gather every team member for an online Skype meeting. This way we would be able to, during a discussion of the current project, to develop multiple different subgroups, in the team, and not just the two general subgroups as Denmark and Kenya. With these subgroups in place, one would have a much better foundation and a more solid team.

\subsection{Product}\label{subsec:product}
(It is difficult to discuss the product when it is not done)
In the section product, we want to discuss our final product. Questions one could ask:

\begin{itemize}
	%%%% ASLAK: What works?
	\item What could be improved?
	\item Prototype? %%% Explain that it is a prototype
	\item Future work?
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Project}\label{subsec:project}
In this section we want to discuss the overall project and not only focus on the end product. Instead we want to put the collaborative experience in the spotlight and focus on what could be improved regarding the collaboration, such as tools and methods. 

It has become clear to us that we could not have a lot of things differently in regards to the collaboration. This has become clear because we believe that the lack of interest in the project from the Kenyan group does not originate from our approaches but instead from a direct lack of interest in the project. Two members have directly responded that they do not wish to participate in the project, one is not actively participating and the last group member is highly unreliable. These motivational challenges are core values that one needs to have. No strategies or collaborative approaches could have transformed the situation to something positive. These challenges are not a part of a normal work setting, thus one probably would be reprimanded by not attending meetings, replying to emails and show lack of motivation.

If the initial motivation was there, a lot of methods could have been used to kick off a great collaborative team. Some of them are discussed in \ref{chapter:method}. One approach that could have been useful was to introduce each others countries and talk about topics not directly related to the core project. This way one would learn the different team members to know, and know more about them than their professional skills. This could have been done by just simply introducing one self, family life, interests, hobbies and the likes.



\begin{itemize}
	\item What was good?
	\item What was not so good?
	\item How would we approach collaboration in a new project? Do anything different?
\end{itemize}
