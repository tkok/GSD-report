%\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}
In this section we are going to discuss our project in three different parts, one being the collaboration with the team members from Kenya, the other being the product and lastly the overall project. We have chosen to analyse each of these areas with an approach of highlighting what could have been done differently and perhaps in a better and more successful way. We will reflect on our choices made during the project and finally also on our learning outcomes.

\subsection{Collaboration}\label{subsec:collaboration}
The collaboration between the students at ITU, Denmark and Strathmore, Kenya, proved to be a rather challenging task. Only one person from Strathmore showed interest in the project, even though this should have been four persons. We believe that this is not caused by our approach towards the students from Kenya but instead by a lack of interest and willingness to work on the project.
With that being said, there could have been multiple ways we could have achieved a better performing team. Our collaboration strategy is still in the early phases due to the fact that we as a group never got to create any real collaboration platform to work from. 
A natural next approach, that we have tried multiple times to do, would be to gather every team member for an online Skype meeting. This way we would be able to, during a discussion of the current project, to develop multiple different subgroups, see \ref{par:ethnocentrism}, in the team, and not just the two general subgroups as Denmark and Kenya. With these subgroups in place, one would have a much better foundation and a more solid team.

\subsection{Product}\label{subsec:product}
(It is difficult to discuss the product when it is not done)
In the section product, we want to discuss our final product. Questions one could ask:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What could be improved?
	\item Prototype?
	\item Future work?
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Project}\label{subsec:project}
(It is difficult to discuss the overall project when we still have one month left)
A general overview of the project:

\begin{itemize}
	\item What was good?
	\item What was not so good?
	\item How would we approach collaboration in a new project? Do anything different?
\end{itemize}
