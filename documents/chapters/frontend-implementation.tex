\subsection{Initial Ideas}
Initial ideas. User-interaction

The main idea for the user interface was to keep is simple and user-friendly without loosing advance functionally. To better understand what we were dealing with we initial started with some rough drawings, planing ahead how the visuals would look like, and the functionally of the interactions with the user.

We knew that the project could easily expand and become far too complex to we set up implementing a simple skeleton with the most basic elements needed.

The primary parts of the frontend include:
Listing already existing and active policies
Adding, deleting and modifying policies
A visual representation of the building with floor and rooms (like a map)
Visual representation of sensor values group towards the individual rooms they represent.

\subsection{Usability}
Something about the choise made towards the useability of the user interface, or at least ideas how we would improve the user interface to be more userfriendly.


\subsection{Tech Choices}
Why java, benifits? due to policy engine with object classes etc. Original plan to use PHP expected it to be simple to use java classed to handle the policies.
