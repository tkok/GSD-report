%\section{Evaluation}
%%%% ASLAK: Start by explaining why these areas are: 1. important 2. covers what is important
In our project we have two areas that we have been evaluating. The first being if our policy engine is actually working and enforcing the defined policies. The other being the front end interface, testing to uncover potential usability issues that needed solving.

\subsection{Policy Engine System Evaluation}

\paragraph{Log Testing}

Log every action and check timestamps, values, actions etc...

\paragraph{JUnit Testing}
.......

\subsection{Usability Test}

\paragraph{Think Aloud Test}

In a thinking aloud test, you ask test participants to use the system while continuously thinking out loud â€” that is, simply verbalizing their thoughts as they move through the user interface.

To run a basic thinking aloud usability study, you need to do only 3 things:

Recruit representative users.
Give them representative tasks to perform. %%ASLAK: Perhaps someone from FM??
Shut up and let the users do the talking.


Cheap, simple, flexible....

Research shows that testing 5 persons uncover 80\% of all usability problems...

\subsection{Technology}
In the beginning of the project we talked about the many technologies available for web development. Obviously there are many approaches to the same solution. Focussing on working as a team, that all have different background experiences we decided to individually write down our development qualifications.

From all of the qualifications in the group, we joined together and made a top three technology approached (see Tabel \ref{tbl:dev_environment}. Every team member voted 1, 2 and 3 on an development approach. 1 being the most preferred, and three the less preferred.
