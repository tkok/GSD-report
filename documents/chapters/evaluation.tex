\section{Evaluation}
In our project we have two areas that we are evaluating. The first being if our policy engine is actually working and enforcing the defined policies. The other being the front end interface. The goal have been to uncover usability issues that needed solving.

\subsection{Policy engine system evaluation}

\paragraph{Log testing}




\subsection{Usability testing}

\paragraph{Think aloud test}

In a thinking aloud test, you ask test participants to use the system while continuously thinking out loud â€” that is, simply verbalizing their thoughts as they move through the user interface.

To run a basic thinking aloud usability study, you need to do only 3 things:

Recruit representative users.
Give them representative tasks to perform.
Shut up and let the users do the talking.


Cheap, simple, flexible....

Research shows that testing 5 persons uncover 80\% of all usability problems...
