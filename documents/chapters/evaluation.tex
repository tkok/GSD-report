%\section{Evaluation}
In our project we have two areas that we have been evaluating. The first being if our policy engine is actually working and enforcing the defined policies. The other being the front end interface, testing to uncover potential usability issues that needed solving.

\subsection{Policy engine system evaluation}

\paragraph{Log testing}

Log every action and check timestamps, values, actions etc...

\paragraph{Unit tests}
.......

\subsection{Usability testing}

\paragraph{Think aloud test}

In a thinking aloud test, you ask test participants to use the system while continuously thinking out loud â€” that is, simply verbalizing their thoughts as they move through the user interface.

To run a basic thinking aloud usability study, you need to do only 3 things:

Recruit representative users.
Give them representative tasks to perform.
Shut up and let the users do the talking.


Cheap, simple, flexible....

Research shows that testing 5 persons uncover 80\% of all usability problems...
