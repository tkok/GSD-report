\section{Method}
%\label{sec:method}
Before any actual work could start, one preliminary goal was to figure out how we could make our group work together as one. Actually this challenge is even more challenging in this project than in a normal work situation: No organization is in order, no predefined roles, no actual project goals and the likes. This chapter will focus on these challenges and how we tried to handle these. We will highlight different methods to create social interaction and understanding. We will focus on how one can rationalize collaboration. Afterwards we will discuss the different tools we used throughout the project life cycle with collaboration in mind. Finally, we will discuss how one can manage a virtual project.\\

\subsection{Social Context}
When we discuss the \textit{Social Context}, we discuss the direct milieu in which the person is and how different factors can influence this person. Communication is also a part of the social context, which is not necessarily only between two persons but can be between one to many persons, in different time zones, different cultures etc.\\
\paragraph{Common ground}
Our first step to connect to our fellow group mates in Kenya was to introduce ourselves via an e-mail and just shortly highlight some common information about each person from ITU, like stating name, age etc. This method is known as creating ``common ground'', as introduced by Olson and Olson \textbf{REFERENCE}. The term to create common ground ``refers to that knowledge that the participants have in common, and they are aware that they have it in common''\textbf{REFERENCE}. Common ground is not only established through simple general knowledge about each participant. It is also created through a persons behaviour and appearance through meetings and conversations. We tried to use this method as a way of getting to know our team members, to create a level of understanding and finally to create a stepping stone from which the project could evolve from.

This initial contact was already quite frustrating because of the fact that it was difficult to get a reply from some of the group members in Kenya, only two members was relatively easy to get in touch with. This leads directly to two different considerations in our group work: ``Trust''textbf{REFERENCE} and ``First impressions matters''textbf{REFERENCE}. Trust in group work is a value of high much the different team members trust in each other. How much does one believe that the other team members will deliver their part of the necessary work? How much does one believe that a mail we be answered? How well does the team work together? The trust is between the two subgroups, Denmark and Kenya, relatively low because of the amount -and lack of- replies and general communication. At the time being we only expect one member from Kenya to be online during our team sessions but at the same time we expect everybody from the ITU-group to be online at every session. This is also translatable from the first impressions that we received from the group from Kenya. It is not in any way rewarding for the group atmosphere not to join group conversations and not replying emails. 

The literature for these topics seems to agree that these sort of problems generally arise from two different topics. One being ``Collaboration- & Technology Readines'' and the other ``Continuities/Discontinuities''.
