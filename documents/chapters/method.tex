\section{Method}
%\label{sec:method}
Before any actual work could start, one preliminary goal was to figure out how we could make our group work together as one. Actually this challenge is even more challenging in this project than in a normal work situation: No organization is in order, no predefined roles, no actual project goals and the likes. This chapter will focus on these challenges and how we tried to handle these. We will highlight different methods to create social interaction and understanding. We will focus on how one can rationalize collaboration. Afterwards we will discuss the different tools we used throughout the project life cycle with collaboration in mind. Finally, we will discuss how one can manage a virtual project.\\

\subsection{Social Context}
When we discuss the \textit{Social Context}, we discuss the direct milieu in which the person is and how different factors can influence this person. Communication is also a part of the social context, which is not necessarily only between two persons but can be between one to many persons, in different time zones, different cultures etc.\\
\paragraph{Common ground}
Our first step to connect to our fellow group mates in Kenya was to introduce ourselves via an e-mail and just shortly highlight some common information about each person from ITU, like stating name, age etc. This method is known as creating ``common ground'', as introduced by Olson and Olson \textbf{REFERENCE}. The term to create common ground ``refers to that knowledge that the participants have in common, and they are aware that they have it in common''\textbf{REFERENCE}. Common ground is not only established through simple general knowledge about each participant. It is also created through a persons behaviour and appearance through meetings and conversations. We tried to use this method as a way of getting to know our team members, to create a level of understanding and finally to create a stepping stone from which the project could evolve from.

This initial contact was already quite frustrating because of the fact that it was difficult to get a reply from some of the group members in Kenya, only two members was relatively easy to get in touch with. This leads directly to two different considerations in our group work: ``Trust''textbf{REFERENCE} and ``First impressions matters''textbf{REFERENCE}. Trust in group work is a value of high much the different team members trust in each other. How much does one believe that the other team members will deliver their part of the necessary work? How much does one believe that a mail we be answered? How well does the team work together? The trust is between the two subgroups, Denmark and Kenya, relatively low because of the amount -and lack of- replies and general communication. At the time being we only expect one member from Kenya to be online during our team sessions but at the same time we expect everybody from the ITU-group to be online at every session. This is also translatable from the first impressions that we received from the group from Kenya. It is not in any way rewarding for the group atmosphere not to join group conversations and not replying emails. 

The literature for these topics seems to agree that these sort of problems generally arise from two different topics. One being ``Collaboration- & Technology Readines'' and the other ``Continuities/Discontinuities''.

\subsection{Collaborative Work}

Collaborative work across cultures is a challenge. In our case we had to work together 9 people with 4 being from Kenya, a culture and country that we before entering this project, didn't know much about. As mentioned earlier the social context and the process of creating 'common ground' with the collaborators is of high importance to create a fundamental shared understanding of the task and build up the motivation and very much needed trust for the collaboration to succeed. Cooperative work is defined by Schmidt REFERENCE as ''People engage in cooperative work when they are mutually dependent in their work and therefore are required to cooperate in order to get the work done,'' (Schmidt)

The bigger the group the more 'articulation work', articulation work is the extra activities required for collaboration. The task at hand defines what is work and what is articulation work. Articulation work is about who does what, when and where. There are mechanisms of interaction that supports the process when articulation work cannot be handled through every day social interaction. These mechanisms are for instance: Organizational structures (formal/informal), plans and schedules and conceptualschemes. What all these mechanisms have in common is that they all strive to reduce the effort in labor, resources, time, etc. required to handle articulation work. 
Our strategy for the articulation work was to define processes and choose the groupware technologies that supported our cause best possible. 


->START NOTES

CSCW: Every real world system is an open system
No formal descriptions can capture collaborative work
Impossible to anticipate every contingency which might occur
Collaboration is open ended
There will always be exception handling
Plans are resources for work

-> Discontinuities
'gaps or lack of coherence in aspects of work, such as work 
setting, task, and relations with other managers' (Watson-Manheim et al., 2002:193)

'a discontinuity, edge, or other dividing characteristic 
present in the work context of team' (Espinosa et al.2003:158)


General properties of discontinuities 
Not stable, but changeable 
Can be seen as highly interlinked â€“ continuum
Can emerge and change over time as people adapt in the teams 
Discontinuities may only affects parts of the work 
Discontinuities often appear in bundles (for instance geography+time
+organizational)
Examples of discontinuities: Temporal (working across time zones, 
geographic work location, work group membership( e.g. who you work 
with), organizational affiliation and cultural backgrounds, expertise related 
(novice vs experts), historical (different version of a product), different 
professions (e.g. developers and researchers) or different technologies.

-> Continuities

Stable factors in the collaboration that the participants are 
aware of and consciously act on, or they may be implicit and 
unrecognized. (Watson-Manheim et al., 2002:200) 

Continuities can appear to routine or invisible in order to 
overcome discontinuities
Can be described as strategies or factors to overcome 
discontinuities
